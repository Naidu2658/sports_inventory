                                            Sports Inventory  

Problem statement: John wants to play badminton and thought of issuing the rackets from his college sports department. Along with his partner he went to the sports room for issuing the rackets and found that all the rackets were already get issued by some other students and ended up in disappointment. He wished that if somehow he get to know this before it would have helped him to not waste their time.  

Proposed solution: We can have an android application where we can keep track of all the available sports equipment. Where the admin will be updating the availability of equipment students can know from their mobile phones that whether there are sufficient tools or not.   

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Functionality & Concepts used: This application was built using simple UI to demonstrate the use cases. Used simple ui elements like radio group and radio buttons and added some basic buttons which are useful for navigation between the activities.

Future scope: Thinking of integrating my application to the application developed by my other college mates which is used for food menu tracker and canteen menu availability so that everything can be accessed from one place.  I am also thinking of extending the functionality to pre-book the available sports equipment for a certain amount of time period.
